### 🕯️ Lithophane Night Lamp – 3D Printed Custom Design

This project is a **handcrafted lithophane night lamp** 🛠️🖼️ designed and 3D printed from scratch, combining digital modeling, artistic image processing, and functional product design.

---

#### 🖼️ What I Made

I started with a simple 2D photo and transformed it into a beautiful **lithophane** – a 3D-printed panel that reveals the image when lit from behind. Lithophanes use thickness variations to control light, making the image appear in stunning detail when backlit 🌟.

#### 🧰 Tools & Process

Here's how I made it:

1. **Image Conversion** 🎞️
   I used an online lithophane generator (such as [3DP Rocks](http://3dp.rocks/lithophane/) or [ItsLitho](https://itslitho.com/)) to convert a grayscale image into a 3D model (STL) where brighter parts are thinner and darker parts are thicker.

2. **3D Printing the Lithophane** 🖨️
   I printed the lithophane using white PLA filament with fine layer height (0.1 mm) for better detail. Vertical orientation was used to retain sharpness and contrast when lit.

3. **Custom Box Design** 📦
   To turn the lithophane into a **functional night lamp**, I designed a custom box in \[Fusion 360 / Tinkercad / Blender – replace as needed]. The box includes:

   * A **precise slot** to hold the lithophane panel securely
   * **Internal space** to house a small LED or USB-powered light 💡
   * Optional **vents or decorative cutouts** to enhance glow and airflow

4. **Assembly** 🪛
   Once both parts were printed, I inserted the lithophane into the front slot of the box, placed a light source inside, and closed it up. The result? A soft-glowing, image-based night lamp – both **personalized and practical** 🌙✨.
