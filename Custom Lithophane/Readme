🕯️ Lithophane Night Lamp – 3D Printed Custom Design
This project is a handcrafted lithophane night lamp 🛠️🖼️ designed and 3D printed from scratch, combining digital modeling, 
artistic image processing, and functional product design.

🖼️ What I Made
I started with a simple 2D photo and transformed it into a beautiful lithophane – a 3D-printed panel that reveals the image when lit from behind. 
Lithophanes use thickness variations to control light, making the image appear in stunning detail when backlit 🌟.

🧰 Tools & Process
Here's how I made it:

Image Conversion 🎞️
I used an online lithophane generator (such as 3DP Rocks or ItsLitho) to convert a grayscale image into a 3D model (STL) 
where brighter parts are thinner and darker parts are thicker.

3D Printing the Lithophane 🖨️
I printed the lithophane using white PLA filament with fine layer height (0.1 mm) for better detail. 
Vertical orientation was used to retain sharpness and contrast when lit.

Custom Box Design 📦
To turn the lithophane into a functional night lamp, I designed a custom box in [Fusion 360 / Tinkercad / Blender – replace as needed]. 

The box includes:
A precise slot to hold the lithophane panel securely
Internal space to house a small LED or USB-powered light 💡

Assembly 🪛
Once both parts were printed, I inserted the lithophane into the front slot of the box, placed a light source inside, and closed it up.
The result? A soft-glowing, image-based night lamp – both personalized and practical 🌙✨.

🔋 Features
🔲 Fully 3D printable
🖼️ Supports any image (portraits work best)
🔌 Compatible with USB LED lights
📐 Custom box modeling for a clean and seamless fit
🛏️ Perfect for bedrooms, desks, or gifting 🎁

🌟 Final Result
The printed lithophane glows beautifully in the dark, turning a simple photo into a warm, ambient light source. 
It’s a great way to add a personal touch to home decor or create a meaningful gift.
