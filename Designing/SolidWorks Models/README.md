# 🤖 SolidWorks 3D Models Collection

Welcome to my **SolidWorks 3D Modeling Repository**!  
I'm an **Automation and Robotics Engineering student**, and this repository contains all the CAD models I’ve created so far—and will continue to create—as part of my learning journey in mechanical design and 3D modeling.

All models are organized within **a single folder** for simplicity and ease of access.

## 📦 Contents

This repository includes various models created using **SolidWorks**, including:

- `.SLDPRT` – Part files  
- `.SLDASM` – Assembly files  
- `.SLDDRW` – Drawing files (if available)  
- Reference images (if any)

### 📝 Highlighted Projects

- **Connecting Rod Model**  
  Created as part of the "Basics of SolidWorks" certification course by SourceCAD. Focused on parametric part design and assembly fundamentals.

*(More models will be added as I progress.)*
