🦾 Development of a 4-DOF Articulated Robot for Color-Based Sorting

📌 Overview

A 4-DOF articulated robotic arm designed for real-time color-based object sorting. The robot detects object colors using a color sensor and automatically sorts them to designated locations with high precision.

⚙️ Features
