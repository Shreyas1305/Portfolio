# Credit Score Prediction Model

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit scores using Machine Learning. A credit score is an essential financial metric used by lenders to assess the creditworthiness of an individual. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this model aims to provide accurate predictions based on various financial and demographic factors.

## 🔍 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw financial data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Using various ML algorithms to predict credit scores.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model for real-time predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Personal details (Age, Employment Type, etc.)
- Financial information (Loan history, Outstanding balance, etc.)
- Behavioral patterns (Payment history, Credit utilization, etc.)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation and processing
- **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Flask / FastAPI** (Optional) - For deploying the model as an API
