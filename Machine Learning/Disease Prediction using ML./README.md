# 🏥 Disease Prediction System  

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System** that helps identify potential diseases based on user symptoms. The system uses **data-driven analysis** to suggest possible conditions and assist in early diagnosis.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Predicts diseases based on symptoms input by the user  
✅ Uses **Machine Learning** algorithms for accurate predictions  
✅ Provides insights and preventive measures for detected diseases  
✅ User-friendly interface for easy interaction  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Flask/Django for the backend)  
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest, Decision Trees, or Deep Learning models)  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data handling & processing)  
- **Streamlit / React** (Frontend for UI)  

## 📌 How to Use  
- Enter symptoms and get predictions!  

## 🏆 Future Enhancements  
🔹 Integrating **AI-powered chatbots** for health advice  
🔹 Connecting with **wearable health devices** for real-time monitoring  
🔹 Expanding the database for **rare diseases**
